# Music Dataset

Music dataset used throughout the tutorials. The `music_schema.ttl` is a simple schema for the music dataset. The `beatles.ttl` is a tiny version of the dataset with only a handful triples. The `music.ttl.gz` is a small subset of the [DBpedia dataset](https://wiki.dbpedia.org) and have been simplified to use the simple schema we have.
